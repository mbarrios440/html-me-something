                    <p>He's a super sweet chunky boi, and also othe most independent between the two of 
                       them. Most of the time he'll be found sleeping on one of their squishy beds or eating.</p>

                    <p>This one's a big attention seeker! He's always ready to play and a little crazy at 
                       times(specially in the mornings). He always wants to cuddle with us when he's sleepy.</p>

                    <p>I used to be the type of person that would rather not have any pets, but after a little 
                    convincing from my girlfriend, we ended up adopting these two brothers, and I can say it's 
                    been one of the best decisions we've made. Just having them around, and seeing how excited they get when they see us coming 
                    back from work, or when we wake up makes me happy. They make our apartment feel more like a home.</p>
