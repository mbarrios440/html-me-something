                    <h2>Chibi</h2>
                    <p>He's a super sweet chunky boi, and also othe most independent between the two of 
                       them. Most of the time he'll be found sleeping on one of their squishy beds or eating.</p>

                    <h2>Copper</h2>
                    <p>This one's a big attention seeker! He's always ready to play and a little crazy at 
                       times(specially in the mornings). He always wants to cuddle with us when he's sleepy.</p>

                    <p>I used to be the type of person that would rather not have any pets, but after a little 
                    convincing from my girlfriend, we ended up adopting these two brothers, and I can say it's 
                    been one of the best decisions I've made. They make our home feel more like a home
                    and honestly I couldn't imagine going back to the quietness before we had them.</p>
